### Step 1: Open the Vault Selector

1. In the **bottom-left corner**, you’ll see your current vault name — right now it says **“Obsidian Vault”**.
    
2. Click on that name (⚙️ or folder icon nearby).
    
3. It’ll open a **Vault Manager** window — where you can **create**, **open**, or **switch** vaults.

### 🆕 Step 2: Create a New Vault

3. Choose a folder location on your system (Obsidian will create that folder).
    
4. Hit **“Create”**.

### 📂 Step 3: Add Notes & Folders

Now your new vault opens automatically.

- To **add a folder:** right-click in the left sidebar → **New Folder**.
    
- To **add a note:** click the “+” icon (top left) → **New Note**.
    
    - or press `Ctrl + N` (Windows/Linux).

### ⚡ Tip:

Each vault is **fully separate** — you can keep one for college notes, another for personal stuff, etc.
